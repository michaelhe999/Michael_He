Hello World! My name is Michael He, an undergraduate Computer Science major at UC San Diego. 

I've participated in several UCSD research labs, worked as a computer science tutor and instructor, held positions in student organizations, and completed several projects relating to my interests in Artificial Intelligence, App Development, and Software Engineering. Information on any of this can be found on the CV tab of the website. 

Outside of my academic interests, I like to play badminton and go rock-climbing. 

<!--- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. --->
